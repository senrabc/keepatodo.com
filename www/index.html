TODO: [A](senrabc@gmail.com)20170501 @story The idea will be to run the raw        
  nacc data through the ALGDX algo. and then output something like:

  Aim 1: To subclassify older adults into well-defined cognitive status            
  entities, using a diagnostic algorithm which takes into account a combination 
  of amnestic and non-amnestic neuropsychological tests scores and the assigned 
  clinical dementia rating.                                                        
                                                                                   
  Aim 1 hypothesis: Older adults will be classified into well-defined cognitive 
  status categories after review and categorization using a combination of         
  neuropsychological tests scores and CDR rating.

TODO: [A](senrabc@gmail.com)20170501 @story In the grant we said we would turn  
  DxSter into the enhanced Algorithmic Diagnosis (eAlgDx). The new required        
  inputs woudl be CDR sum of boxes for the NPDX a map is needed to map nacc        
  UDS values to the ALgDx. A truth table was created in the grant for this.

*******************************************************************************
Why?
*******************************************************************************
The longer a code base exists the more likely it is that all external artifacts
associated with it will disappear. I can't tell you how many wiki articles I've
authored or edited over the years only to see them somehow get relegated and 
lost since the were not with the code. It gets to be disheartening. So a 
radical idea occurred to me. Why not just go back to keeping artifacts with the 
code. Before you fire up your blow torch to flame me, I'm not talking about 
abandoning all external systems. I'm talking about folks who may be in the 
terminal/vim/emacs all day long anyway going back to a tried and true method of
tracking things that need to get done. Your mileage may very.

*******************************************************************************
Advantage for Humans
*******************************************************************************
Advantages, here are a few for using a text based TODO:

	1. Your TODO items will get versioned right along with your code.
	2. Your TODO list will always be human readable, ala Unix Philosophy.
	3. Your text file will pretty much always be cross platform and future
          proof ;)
	4. I edited this with VIM over an ssh session. No GUI needed. Fast and
          quick.
